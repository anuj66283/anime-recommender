# Anime Recommendation System

A fun project that suggests animes based on your preferences.

## How It Works
- **Content-Based:** Suggests anime similar to what you like by analyzing genres. It calculates the TF-IDF for genres and computes a similarity score.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Recommends anime loved by people with similar tastes. Here, ALS is utilized to determine optimal parameters.
- **Hybrid:** Combines both approaches for tailored suggestions.
